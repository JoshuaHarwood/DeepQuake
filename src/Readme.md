#### Components needed:

**react-chartjs-2:**

###### npm install --save react-chartjs-2 chart.js


**tomtom libraries:**

###### npm i @tomtom-international/web-sdk-maps
######npm i @tomtom-international/web-sdk-services

#### Once you have installed the needed dependancies then you will need a tomtom api Key:

###### In order to run this on your own machine you will need to create a API key with TomTom and add it to Keys.keys.json,
an example of how the Json would look like is:

    "Keys" : {
        "TomTom" : "[API Key]"
    }
